# Developer technical assessment

This repository contains the technical assessment for developers applying to work at Effecti. The assessment consists of developing a ToDo application using Vue.js 2.

### Objective

Develop a ToDo application in Vue.js 2 that allows users to manage a list of tasks with features like creating, editing, deleting, filtering, and local storage, focusing on state management with Vuex and performance optimization techniques.

### Functional requirements

| # | Title                      | Description                                                                                      |
|---|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Add task**               | Create new tasks with fields for `title`, `description`, and `priority` (low, medium, high).  Ok   |
| 2 | **Edit task**              | Update existing tasks.                                                                        Ok   |

| 4 | **Mark task as completed** | Mark tasks as completed or pending.                                                           Ok   |
| 5 | **Filter tasks**           | Filter tasks by status (completed, pending, or all).                                          Ok   |   
| 6 | **Sorting tasks**          | Order tasks by priority (low, medium, high).                                                  Ok   | 

### Technical requirements

| # | Requirement                          | Description                                                                                       |
|---|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **State Management with Vuex**       | Use Vuex to manage the state of the application.                                            Ok      |
| 2 | **Actions & Mutations**              | Define actions and mutations to update the state of the application.                        Ok      |
| 3 | **Modularization**                   | Organize actions, mutations, and state into modules if needed for clarity.                  Ok      |
| 4 | **Data persistence**                 | Persist task data in `localStorage` so tasks remain available upon page reload.             Ok      |
| 5 | **Responsive Layout**                | Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and functions well on various screen sizes.               Ok      |
| 6 | **Reusable Components**              | Organize components for reusability and maintainability.                                    Ok      |
| 6.1 | **Task List Component**            | Create a reusable component for displaying a list of tasks.                                 Ok      |
| 6.2 | **Task Item Component**            | Create a reusable component for displaying individual tasks.                                Ok      |
| 6.3 | **Task Form Component**            | Create a reusable component for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.                        Ok      |


### Bonus points

1. **Large Data Set Simulation**: Simulate a large number of tasks (e.g., 100+ tasks) to test the appâ€™s responsiveness.                  Ok
2. **Search Feature**: Implement a quick search to find tasks by `title` or `description`.                                               Ok
3. **Optimized Rendering**: Use techniques such as `virtual scroll` to handle large task lists efficiently.                              Ok
